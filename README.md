##Project Title
Hunt the Wumpus is a classic text-based computer game written by Gregory Yob in 1972. The goal of this game is to travel through the maze and kill Wampus.

##About a Game

The Wumpus live in a cave of many rooms: each room has 3 tunnels leading to other rooms. Cave rooms are generated randomly (even Wampus himself is often lost in his house).

There are some hazards in the cave: bottomless pit (if you got there - you lose); super bats in two different rooms. If you got there - a bat grabs you and takes to another random room. In flight, you can lose a random number of arrows.

The Wumpus is not afraid of pits and his pets - bats (it has suckerfeet to get out of the pit). Usually he is asleep. There are two things wake him up: your entering his room or your shooting an arrow.

If the Wumpus wakes (with a high degree of probability), it will move to another room (if it comes to you, you will be eaten). 

There are arrows left over from a past guest in one of the rooms. Hope you have better luck than him. At the beginning of the game, you are given 5.

If you are near a Wumpus or bat room, you will smell bad or hear the rustling of wings.
